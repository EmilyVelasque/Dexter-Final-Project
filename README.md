# Dexter-Final-Project
This is my final project for my Stats class at TCNJ, where I analyzed scenes from the popular show Dexter. My group and I watched over 140 scenes to collect data on the number of main characters, tension levels, gruesomeness, and Dexter's inner thoughts.

**Instructions**

To utilize the script, open the "velasquez.R" file that contains my code for the findings, a the "raw_data.csv"

**Data**

My group and I began by selecting 8 qualitative and 8 quantitative variables, which gave us a total of 16 different variables to work with. Before we could begin observing the show, we first defined what qualifies as a scene. We agreed that a new scene begins whenever the location changes. For example, if the main character, Dexter, moves from being in a car to being at his home, this would mark a scene change. With this understanding in place, we decided to focus on five specific episodes from season one of Dexter on Netflix: episodes 1, 4, 7, 10, and 11, which we chose for variety. We collected a total of 147 observations across all 16 variables. In this analysis, I concentrated on two qualitative variables, gruesomeness and tension, and two quantitative variables, the number of characters and Dexter’s inner thoughts. 

**Operationalization**

We operationalized all of the variables, which means we defined and measured each conception in a way that could be tested. For example, we operationalized “gruesomeness” as the main character being in the presence of a murder crime scene or a murder occurring. To measure this, we used this qualitative variable as a dummy variable, which is a type of variable with two or more categories represented by the numbers 0 and 1. In this case, the value of 1 indicated yes, there was gruesomeness, and the number 0 indicated that there wasn’t any gruesomeness.

Another qualitative variable was tension, which was operationalized based on the presence of unease or high-stakes moments in a scene. This variable was coded as follows: 1 for low tension, 2 for moderate tension, and 3 for high tension. 

The next two variables are quantitative, meaning they represent numeric data that can be measured and ordered. The variables include the number of main characters in a scene and the number of times Dexter thinks to himself, with his inner thoughts audible to the viewers. Both of these are discrete variables, meaning their values are countable and are typically whole numbers.
